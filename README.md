# giko-sync

This is the sync addon.

Synchronize monitored monster tods data (giko-cache) with an external json source via http requests.

This addon is not mandatory but with it and a web server you wont need to do "@giko sync" with the broadcaster to get updated tods. Everything will be done automatically. 

Dependencies: giko-cache, giko-common
